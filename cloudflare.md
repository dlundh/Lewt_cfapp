Lewt is a different kind of marketing tool designed to make website visitors stay longer on your web pages. Offer rewards and prices to visitors who earn enough credits from browsing your products and services. You decide what is important to see on your website, and can offer credits when visitors browse it in the most preferred way. 

### How does it work?

When credits are earned, a coin with the amount of credits earned appear on the screen with a sound effect. This effect can be triggered when visitors click on a link, button, image or any other HTML element that you specify. You need to know basic HTML to take full advantage of Lewt, but you can view examples for how to offer credits if you are a HTML novice.

### Rewards

Lewt supports different types of rewards, such as physical goods, memberships, coupon codes and more. If you want to offer an Amazon gift card as a reward, you can specify the required amount of credits and the gift card code. The visitor who first earns the required amount can claim the reward and reveal the coupon code. This removes the reward from your website and prevents other visitors from trying to earn it. If you have a discount code, you can allow any number of visitors to earn the reward. You may offer goods like branded t-shirts, product samples and anything else you may want to give away, and only charge a shipping fee to mail it.

### Credits

You set the amount of credits you want to offer for a click, such as 1 credit for a click on a link. You can also specify click sequences if you want to reward visitors for completing a process like paying for a product. The credits can then be given at the last click of a "Pay Now" button, and have a higher amount than individual clicks. It is up to you how you reward your visitors and how much they need to earn to get your rewards.

### Let your visitors know

Tell your website visitors about the reward(s) you offer, and show a link to Lewt where they can learn more. Your website will also be listed on Lewt where it can be discovered by our members. The Lewt website address is http://lewt.it.
