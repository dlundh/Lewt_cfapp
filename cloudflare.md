Lewt is a different kind of marketing tool designed to make website visitors staying longer on your web pages. Offer rewards and prices to visitors who earn enough credits from browsing your products and services. You decide what is important to see on your website, and offer credits when visitors browse it in the most preferred way. 

### How does it work?

When credits are earned, a coin with the amount of credits earned appear on the screen with a sound effect. This effect can be triggered when visitors click on a link, button, image or any other HTML element that you specify. You need to know basic HTML to take full advantage of Lewt, but you can view examples for how to offer credits if you are a HTML novice.
